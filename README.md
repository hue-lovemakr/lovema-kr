# Seoul Theme for VS Code

**Seoul Theme** is a premium color suite for VS Code, deeply inspired by the traditional colors of Korea (O-bang-saek and Seoul Colors). It is designed to provide **maximum visual comfort** and **aesthetic satisfaction** through three distinct moods.

## 🎨 Themes

### 1. Seoul Dancheong (단청)
> *The Vivid Palace.*

- **Mood**: Calm, Quiet, Deep.
- **Concept**: Like a quiet walk along the Han River at night.

  - Text: `Sosaek` (Warm Beige) and `Jangdansaek` (Soft Red).

## 🌿 Philosophy: Visual Comfort

This theme is NOT a port. It is built from the ground up using a strictly curated `palette.json` based on traditional Korean color standards.

- **Zero Eye Strain**: We avoid pure black (#000000) and pure white (#ffffff) where possible to reduce contrast fatigue.
- **Natural Harmony**: Colors are derived from nature—soil, rocks, pine trees, and flowers—creating a naturally harmonious look.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Open **Extensions** sidebar in VS Code.
2. Search for `Seoul Theme`.
3. Install and select your preferred mood: **Night**, **Dancheong**, or **Morning**.
